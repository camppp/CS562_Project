    """
    A class for implementing a two-additive-factor Gaussian model for financial analysis.

    Attributes:
        phi_func (function): A function representing the time-dependent factor, φ(t).
        x_mean (float): The mean of the additive factor x.
        x_std (float): The standard deviation of the additive factor x.
        y_mean (float): The mean of the additive factor y.
        y_std (float): The standard deviation of the additive factor y.

    Methods:
        __init__(self, phi_func): Initializes the model with the given function phi_func.
        calculate_interest_rate_change(self, t, x, y): Calculates the interest rate change based on the model equation.
        analyze_model(self): Analyzes the model and prints relevant information about the model parameters and behavior.
