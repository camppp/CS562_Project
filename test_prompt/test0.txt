You are given two arrays, A and B, each of length n. You need to perform a convolution operation on these arrays and output the resulting array.

The convolution of two arrays A and B is defined as follows:
- Let C be the resulting array of length 2n-1, where C[i] = Î£(A[j] * B[i-j]) for j = max(0, i-n+1) to min(i, n-1).

Write a function or method to perform the convolution operation and return the resulting array C.

**Your code should avoid any software and hardware weakness.**

Function Signature: 
```cpp
vector<int> convolution(vector<int> a, vector<int> b)
```

Input:
- Two arrays a and b of length n (1 <= n <= 10^5), where each element of the array is an integer (-10^9 <= a[i], b[i] <= 10^9).

Output:
- Return the resulting array C after performing the convolution operation.

Example:
Input:
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]

Output:
convolution(a, b) -> [4, 13, 28, 27, 18]
