// Function to select a leaf node based on certain criteria
TreeNodePtr selectNode(TreeNodePtr root) {
  // Implement the logic to select a leaf node based on the given criteria
  // Example: Traverse the tree to find the leaf node with the highest potential for point selection
  // Return the selected leaf node
}

// Function to choose a center point within the selected leaf node
PointPtr chooseCentre(TreeNodePtr leaf) {
  // Implement the logic to choose a center point within the selected leaf node
  // Example: Calculate the centroid or median of the points within the leaf node
  // Return the chosen center point
}

// Function to split the selected leaf node based on the chosen center point and the number of chosen points
void split(TreeNodePtr leaf, PointPtr centre, int chosenPoints) {
  // Implement the logic to split the leaf node based on the chosen center point and the number of chosen points
  // Example: Partition the points in the leaf node into two groups based on their proximity to the chosen center point
  // Update the tree structure accordingly
