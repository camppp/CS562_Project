# The given code snippet seems to be part of a tree data structure, possibly a binary tree or a variant of it.

# Assuming the data structure is a binary tree, the Delete function can be implemented as follows:

class Node:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.key = key
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def delete(root, key):
    if root is None:
        return False  # Key does not exist in the tree

    if key < root.key:
        root.left = delete(root.left, key)
    elif key > root.key:
        root.right = delete(root.right, key)
    else:
        # Node with only one child or no child
        if root.left is None:
            temp = root.right
            root = None
            return temp
        elif root.right is None:
            temp = root.left
            root = None
            return temp

        # Node with two children: Get the inorder successor (smallest in the right subtree)
        temp = minValueNode(root.right)

        # Copy the inorder successor's content to this node
        root.key = temp.key

        # Delete the inorder successor
        root.right = delete(root.right, temp.key)

    return root

def minValueNode(node):
    current = node
    # Loop down to find the leftmost leaf
    while current.left is not None:
        current = current.left
    return current
